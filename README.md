# Edabit_Challenges
Challenges from Edabit site.  <br>
Basically the whole point of this repo is that I do Edabit challenges at a certain difficulty until I get bored with the difficulty, when this happens I move to more difficult challenges.
# Medium difficulty
## Finding Adjacent Nodes

Given an adjacency matrix a function checkAdjacency was written.  <br>
Considering this turned out to be a one-liner let's move on to a higher difficulty.
# Hard
## Imaginary Coding Interview

There were 2 ways to complete it, one was to obviously use 3 if statement to check pairs of list elements, the other approach was to define a sequence and use a for loop to check the whole list with a single if statement.
## Encode Morse

A simple for loop and dictionary accessing by key, a slightly trickier part with inverting the dictionary and replacing list elements, slightly more enjoyable than previous but I'll consider to increase the difficulty after 3 or so more challenges.
