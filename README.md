# Edabit_Challenges
Challenges from Edabit site.  <br>
Basically the whole point of this repo is that I do Edabit challenges at a certain difficulty until I get bored with the difficulty, when this happens I move to more difficult challenges.
# Medium difficulty
## Finding Adjacent Nodes
link: https://edabit.com/challenge/3DAkZHv2LZjgqWbvW  <br>
Given an adjacency matrix a function checkAdjacency was written.  <br>
Considering this turned out to be a one-liner let's move on to a higher difficulty.
# Hard
## Imaginary Coding Interview
link: https://edabit.com/challenge/3A3mHS5B3NNZddQL2  <br>
There were 2 ways to complete it, one was to obviously use 3 if statement to check pairs of list elements, the other approach was to define a sequence and use a for loop to check the whole list with a single if statement.
## Encode Morse

A simple for loop and dictionary accessing by key, a slightly trickier part with inverting the dictionary and replacing list elements, slightly more enjoyable than previous but I'll consider to increase the difficulty after 3 or so more challenges.
## Find Domain Name From DNS Pointer (PTR) Records Using IP Address

By using gethostbyaddr() function of the socket module this was pretty straight forward.
## The Snake â€” Area Filling

Just checking if the snake still fits in the map.
# Very Hard
## Atbash Cipher
link: https://edabit.com/challenge/MGALfBAXhXqqdFyqo <br>
Because it was requested that the capitalisation was to be retained the set of alphabet in lowercase and uppercase was created, from then a certain shifting did all the work.
